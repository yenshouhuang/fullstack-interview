Whether you live waste free or are just trying to remember your reusable coffee cup each morning, living at Common Bosco is a step towards a more sustainable future. As a member, you’ll also enjoy beautiful amenities including a shared indoor lounge and terrace, perfect for remote work or gathering up a gang for game night, and a rooftop deck, complete with incredible views of the hills and bay.\n\n*Common Bosco is Green Point Rated Platinum.*",

You’re also only a short walk away from Shattuck Ave, where you’ll enjoy great restaurants, shops, and every convenience (including a Trader Joe’s!)\n",
