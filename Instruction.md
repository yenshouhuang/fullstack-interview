# Habyt Fullstack Interview Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Habyt Fullstack Interview Project! In this assignment, you will be creating a product page. You have 72-hours to complete and return this project. 

## Objective
Your task is to build a product page that displays an array of available rooms, each with specific details like address, price, availability date, and images.

The data comes from the live Common.com bulk Internet Listing Service (ILS) feed, which is available at https://www.common.com/cmn-api/listings/common and the schema desciption is available here: https://www.common.com/cmn-api/docs#/integration/ListingsController_findAllCommonListings

You can either pull from the feed directly or use the data.json file that includes the first 10 rooms. If you do use the feed you may limit the number of rooms shown to a reasonable number - or not - as you see fit.


## Key Features:
- Display of Rooms: Fetch and display room details from the Common ILS.
  - not all information needs to be displayed. Use your judgement. Essential items to display are - but not limited to - an image, location, price, availability date.
- Booking Feature: Implement a 'Book' button for each room to initiate the booking process.
- Booking Workflow: Create a multi-step booking form which includes:
  - Collecting background information (e.g., name, salary).
  - Confirmation of room details, price, and date.
  - A mock interaction with a service like DocuSign for lease signing.
  - A welcome view upon completion.
  - State should be encoded in the URL
  - The user should be able to go back steps

## API Mocking

API calls should be mocked using Next.js API routes to simulate back-end functionality when needed.

## Technical Requirements
- Framework: Next.js with TypeScript.
- Data Handling: Use the above mentioned ILS feed for room details. User proper validation.
- Mock APIs when necessary: Backend interactions should be mocked using Next.js API routes.

## Getting Started
